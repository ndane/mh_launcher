**MH Launcher is an open source application which enables the installation and injection of ReShade into Monster Hunter: World to enable better Anti-Aliasing and rendering.**

The default settings will enable SMAA which is a much better anti-aliasing technique than the inbuilt TAA and FXAA which make everything blurry.
